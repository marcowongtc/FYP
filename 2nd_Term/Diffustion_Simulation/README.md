# Python | N-Dimensional Random Diffusion Simulation ([program](./Self-developed-program/1D_diffusion_my.py))

N-Dimensional Random Diffusion is simulated by N 1D random walkers with fixed step size.   
The simulation is done in `Python` using package `Numpy`.  

### Step Array
A Step array (Row: $n^{th}$ random walker $N_p$ + Column: $n^{th}$ steps $0-N_s$ ) is generated by random generator with elements either +1 or -1. 
the $0^{th}$ step is set to be 0 for setting all trajectory for the same starting point.  
The step size can be arbitrary adjusted with Step Size array, Step Array = Step Array $\times$ Step Size Array.

### Position Array
The Position array, which carries the trajectory information driven by random diffusion (i.e. random walk), is generated by cumulatively summing the step along the column of Step array.

# Python | Visualization ([program](./animation/diffusion_plot_animation.py))

The trajectory is plotted with `matplotlib.animation` and `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` package. 

### Visualization Treatment 
3D trajectory is plotted for visualization.    
3 1D random walkers would be combined as x, y, z movement of one particle trajectory. Thus 63D random diffusion can be visualized as 21 particle randomly walk in 3D space.
The 3D plot of trajectory is plotted in chronological order of subsequent steps frame by frame. Thus, A `.mp4` video is generated.
